% First, define the document here, this is appropriate: 
% \documentclass[12pt]{article}

% This is the "pre-include" section. Define your first and last name, title, and the appropriate instructor's name and class
% \newcommand{\lastname}{YourLastName}
% \newcommand{\firstname}{YourFirstName}
% \newcommand{\instructorfull}{InstructorName}
% \newcommand{\className}{className}
% \newcommand{\titleName}{Title}
% 
% Now, include this file with the command:
% \include{mla.tex}
% 
\usepackage[american]{babel} 
\usepackage{csquotes} 
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref} % Links otherwise get in the way, so we hide them. Do want you want...
\usepackage[style=mla-new, backend=biber]{biblatex} % Your weird for not using this stuff...(if not why are you really using latex)
\usepackage{datetime}
\usepackage[letterpaper, margin=1.0in]{geometry} %Per mla suggestion, but some instructors deviate...
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\usepackage{setspace}
\usepackage{enotez} % The modern version of the "endnotes" package. 
\setenotez{backref, counter-format=alph, list-heading = \begin{center}#1\end{center}} % Here we enable backlinks and switch the counter to alphabetical since usually there are less end-notes and to differentiate between them and footnotes. Also a neat trick, just change the list-heading field to be unformated and centered per MLA standard.

% We like Zapf's Palatino font for both body text and math, otherwise use something else as requested by instructor
\usepackage{newpxtext,newpxmath}

\newdateformat{dateMLA}{\THEDAY\ \monthname[\THEMONTH] \THEYEAR} % MLA has a specific date standard

\linespread{2} %This is the most "Word"-like double-spacing you get. See https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/13742/what-does-double-spacing-mean. Otherwise, use the "doublespacing" command from setspace package

\fancyhf{}
\rhead{\lastname~\thepage}

\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt} % No headrules for the headers and footers, unless you (and your instructor) are into that...
\renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0pt}

% Ensure header 0.5in from top edge: 12pt font is 1/6 inch
\setlength\headsep{0.333in}
% Set the header height (complains otherwise)
\setlength\headheight{14.49998pt}
% Paragraph indent, 0.5 inches
\setlength\parindent{0.5in}

\pagestyle{fancy} % Every page uses the same style.

% Custom format of bibliography for MLA
\newcommand{\printformatedbibliography}{\newpage\begin{center}Works Cited\end{center}\printbibliography[heading=none]}

% Per MLA requirements, endnotes should appear on a extra page before the bibliography with a header (if you dont use, then just remove this and "theendnotes" command)
\newcommand{\printnotes}{\newpage\printendnotes}

% Useful if you want to introduce an author by their full name initially.
\newrobustcmd*{\citefirstlastauthor}{\AtNextCite{\DeclareNameAlias{labelname}{given-family}}\citeauthor} 

\newenvironment{paper}{
\firstname~\lastname \\

}{
\printnotes % If your not using endnotes, just comment this out...
\printformatedbibliography % Most likely, your should keep this
}

\raggedright %Because MLA is kinda weird...

% The "post-include" section. Simply include your bibliography database file and begin the document. Below is the example code
%
% \bibliography{sources.bib} %<-- BTY, you have to do this post-include.
% \begin{document}
% \begin{paper}
% Here be a footnote \footnote{EEEEE! Sup}. Here be a endnote\endnote{EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! We dont use those often}
% \end{paper}
% \end{document}
